# voice-assist-with-gemini
a voice assisted ai integrated with Google Gemini API to generate responses
# setup?
- just get an API_KEY from developers.google.com
- put that API_KEY in the last line `flee = Flee(username="User", api_key='ADD_YOUR_KEY')`
  - here replace `ADD_YOUR_KEY` with the API_KEY generated
- after that run the script using `python assist.py` 
( make sure to install dependencies, req modules and  etc I'm kinda lazy ðŸ’€ )
